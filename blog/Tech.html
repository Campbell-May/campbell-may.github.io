<h2>Inline vs Inline-Block</h2>

<p>Imagine you are parking cars in a big car lot.
  Lots of the cars are similar size sedans or SUVs. 
  So they are able to be parked using "INLINE" they can all fit in the same 
  row and will all fit in the standard size parks.
  When a campervan turns up to the carpark you realise it is not going to fit nicely. 
  With the campervan you use "INLINE-BLOCK" this lets you continue to add the 
  campervan to your row of cars but you can specify the dimensions 
  of the campervan.

<p>Inline</p>
<p>
  In Css the display property is used to change the way an element is displayed. 
  Inline will display the elements on the same line.
<br>
It will only take up as much width as its content uses. So 
the width and height properties will have no effect.

<p>Inline-Block</p>
<p>With Inline-block, the height and width are taken into account 
  when displaying the element.
  As the name inline suggests, the element will allow other elements to sit 
  to the left and right of it.
  It is very similar to inline except there is a white space area 
  around the element. The Inline-block element is treated as a block. 
  So you are able to adjust the padding and margin around it.
