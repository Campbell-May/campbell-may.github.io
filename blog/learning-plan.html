        <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
      
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>My long term goal is to work in Tech in a way that aligns with my values and passions. Still I am inspired by working for an organisation like Toitu to use Tech to battle carbon emissions, or a company like headspace, making mindfulness accessible through technology.
        </br> 
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
<p>
  The strengths that I first listed in the Foundations Learning Plan were.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Passionate about learning. I really enjoy discovering how things work and solving problems.</li>
  <li>	Friendly and Authentic communication. </li>
  <li>	Calm and positive attitude</li>
</ul>
<p> I definitely feel these are still the most relevant for me going into Bootcamp. 
  I found that I kept a keen interest in learning through foundations by coming up against challenges and having to work out how to solve them. Being really interested in working out a solution definitly helped me stay on track.
</br>
Especially going throught the core learnings I was able to bring more awareness to how I communicate. Practicing the Listening and Looping gave me the opportunity to 
practice active listening and I do feel that I bring an openess and kindness when I speak with others.
</br>
Staying calm and positive when faced with the unknown and frustrations was reinforced by learning about growth mindset. 
I felt more encouraged to be accepting of times where I felt really stuck or blocked. This helped me to stay calm and in some ways welcome the 
frustration because it encouraged me to problem solve and learn.
</p>
<h3>limitations</h3>
<p> One of the things I learnt in the foundations was that I have a tendancy to feel I need to reach a target of competency. If I can;t quite grasp a concept or how something is working I can spend too much time focusing and getting caught up on this 
  instead of moving on and getting on to the next task. I have learnt that sometimes with the tech things we are learning it is just about repitition. For example working with loops I remember getting really caught up trying to understand how the loop worked in each activity even when I got my code working. 
  It wasn't until after a few times using loops in defferent activities that it really started to click. So I learnt that I just need to trust that it will click the more I expose myself to using different code. Also that sometimes the more I grasp at 
  trying to understand something the harder it becomes to comprehend. Sometimes I just need frsh eyes.
</p>
<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
<p>
  I think the biggest non-tech challenge at bootcamp will be speaking and presenting my ideas in front of groups. 
  Just finding my voice and remaining calm so that I can communicate my ideas effectively.


</p>

<h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>This draws directly from what I think will be the most challenging. Speaking in front of groups and putting forward my ideas. Also working on my ability to give constructive feedback. 
  I tend to be quite easy going and avoid confrontation. Perhaps sometimes this means I don't always speak up and offer feedback and discussion. 
Even when others are asking for it and could benefit from it. </p>

<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
<p>
  My Expectations for the Bootcamp team are the same that I had for the foundations team. To offer support when it is needed and constructive, honest feedback about my work and progress through Bootcamp.

</p>

<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
<p>My expectations for myself in Bootcamp are to continue the way that I have in foundations. To treat Bootcamp as a full time job. Following the weekly schedule on campus and then doing suome code in the evening and weekends to stay on top of the material.
   To make sure that I work productivley and safely I will hold myself accountable to continue my mindfulness practices and physical exercise. Looking after my body and my mind. Making sure I get enough sleep will be very important for me.
   I think these things will help me to bring a balanced and calm when I come to Bootcamp and communicate and connect with my peers and the facillitators.
</p>

       <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
<p>My long term goal is to work in the tech industry on projects that align with my values of kindness and empathy. 
  One of the sparks that had me apply for Dev Academy was a job advertisement for web developors for ToitÅ« the environmental care company.
  They help businesses to get carbon zero accreditation and offer tools for the reduction of individual and business carbon footprints.
  I would love to be able to work remotely and continue to live a fairly transient lifestyle. Allowing me to meet 
  and be a part of new communities and places.
</p>
    <p>
      <h3>Strengths</h3> 
      <ul>
      <li>	Passionate about learning. I really enjoy discovering how things work and solving problems.</li>
      <li>	Friendly and Authentic communication. </li>
      <li>	Calm and positive attitude</li>
    </ul>
      <p>My interest in learning and exploring ideas can be great but I do need to be mindful of becoming distracted or going off on tangents that take me out of the 
        timebox frames.</br>
        Also I am naturally easy going and tend to avoid conflict. I would like to work on my ability to speak up. I am hoping Dev Academy will be a great opportunity 
        for me to work on giving and receiving constructive feedback in a safe environment.
      </p>
    
    </p>

    <p>
      The human skills I would like to build while at Dev Academy are mainly around communication and speaking to groups. 
      I feel that I can be quite shy and find it challenging to find my voice in a group setting. Usually when it is talking about 
      myself or one of my ideas. I really enjoy working in groups and find it really useful to share ideas. Its building more confidence 
      when there is attention on me that I would like to develop.
    </p>

    <p>
      How I will manage my workload will be by treating my learning as a full time job.
      I will use the timeboxes and estimated hours of work in foundations to guide my daily structure. While trying to 
      keep my foundations routine similar to bootcamp so that I have a regular rythm already setup by the time we are on campus.
      This helps me to know what hours I should be working and when to rest.
    </br>
    
    When things are building up and starting to get to me I will reach out to facillitators to let them know that I am feeling overwhelmed and 
    what steps I am taking to reduce that feeling. I am very fortunate to have a safe and supportive flat. With very emotionally intelligent flat mates 
    to share and ask for support. 
  </br>
  My expectation of the facillitation team is to be understanding and supportive but firm in helping us to reach our learning objectives and stay on track to complete the course. 
  I expect to recieve honest and constructive feedback about my progress through the course.
  My plan when seeking help is first to ask in Discord if other learners can help me. Then going to the facillitators.
