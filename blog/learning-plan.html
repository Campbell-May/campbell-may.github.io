       <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
<p>My long term goal is to work in the tech industry on projects that align with my values of kindness and empathy. 
  One of the sparks that had me apply for Dev Academy was a job advertisement for web developors for ToitÅ« the environmental care company.
  They help businesses to get carbon zero accreditation and offer tools for the reduction of individual and business carbon footprints.
  I would love to be able to work remotely and continue to live a fairly transient lifestyle. Allowing me to meet 
  and be a part of new communities and places.
</p>
    <p>
      <h3>Strengths</h3> 
      <ul>
      <li>	Passionate about learning. I really enjoy discovering how things work and solving problems.</li>
      <li>	Friendly and Authentic communication. Working in teams comes naturally to me.</li>
      <li>	Calm and positive attitude</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The human skills I would like to build while at Dev Academy are mainly around communication and speaking to groups. 
      I feel that I can be quite shy and find it challenging to find my voice in a group setting. Usually when it is talking about 
      myself or one of my ideas. I really enjoy working in groups and find it really useful to share ideas. Its building more confidence 
      when there is attention on me that I would like to develop.
    </p>

    <p>
      How I will manage my workload will be by treating my learning as a full time job.
      I will use the timeboxes and estimated hours of work in foundations to guide my daily structure. While trying to 
      keep my foundations routine similar to bootcamp so that I have a regular rythm already setup by the time we are on campus.
      This helps me to know what hours I should be working and when to rest.
    </br>
    
    When things are building up and starting to get to me I will reach out to facillitators to let them know that I am feeling overwhelmed and 
    what steps I am taking to reduce that feeling. I am very fortunate to have a safe and supportive flat. With very emotionally intelligent flat mates 
    to share and ask for support. 
  </br>
  My plan when seeking help is first to ask in Discord if other learners can help me. Then going to the facillitators.
