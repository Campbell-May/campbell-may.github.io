        <h2> Core Personal Values
        </h2>
        <p>One of the big ethical decisions I have made was the decision to eat a vegan diet. </br>
          It came through a deeper exploration of my values.</br>
          Three key ones that always come up to me are.
          <ul>
            <li>  
              Kindness</li>
              <li>Compassion</li>
              <li>Empathy</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p> 
       
          My awareness of these three main points had me look at my everyday actions and really ask myself whether I was living according to them.</br>
          After lots of research into 
          The condition of animals in farming. Especially those in the heavily industrialised farming industry.
          The impact on the planet in terms of climate change and pollution.
          My own health. Assessing what I am actually putting into my body and what it is that my body needs. 
          It is also really important to me that I am aware of the position of privilege that I have 
          to be able to eat a vegan diet. I always acknowledge how lucky I am to be in a position to choose not to eat meat.
          
          </p>
          <p>It was a very difficult process to undergo as I have been raised by a family of meat eaters.</br>
          It was made more difficult by feelings of resistance and ridicule of my actions. Especially given that my family
           has always been very supportive of any beliefs or ideas I hold.
           Even now there is a lot of sensitivity and misunderstanding between my family and I.
        Yet ultimately it has been very positive. My family now have regular vegetarian meal nights and we 
      are able to discuss </p>
          <h3>
          Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h3>
          
         <p>
          My family has always been very open to any beliefs and political discussion.</br>
          I was raised largely by my grandparents and had a strong sense of family unity.
          From a young age I was instilled with a strong sense of right or wrong. Not from a particularly religous background 
        but perhaps fairly old school beliefs that my grandparents had. </br>
        A strong cultural norm that I think was very challenging but has developed my personal growth a lot is 
        the individualist and rather stoic attitude that I grew up around. Many male figures and friends in my life have had a 'toughen up' kind 
        of attitude. Which never sat very well with me. I have learnt that gentleness and acceptance of ourselves and others 
        is far healthier.</br>
        I started to read a lot about buddhism and began to regularly practice yoga and meditation. The values that I hold today 
        I believe have been shaped largely by the teachings of buddhism. Which I came to out of a sense of disconnection with 
        the culture and belief I had been exposed to in my childhood.

           <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

           <h3>Strengths</h3> 
            <ul>
            <li>	Passionate about learning. I really enjoy discovering how things work and solving problems.</li>
            <li>	Friendly and Authentic communication.</li>
            <li>	Calm and positive attitude</li>
          </ul>

            
            
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>
            Communication and working in groups. I enjoy this process. I find it fun and very creative. However this intersects with the learning obstacle of not believing in my abilities and sometimes struggling to find my voice to defend ideas or critique others.
            I think that by bringing my calm and positive attitude to communication in a safe space like Dev Academy it will help me develop my confidence 
            and ability to speak up in group environments

            Working in a customer facing job.
            One of the people I worked with was not very aware of the amount of customers and work that a lot of the team was doing. 
            They even had headphones in and were ignoring customers so that everyone else had to do more work.
            I voiced how I was feeling like myself and other members of the team were having to carry the workload.
            I asked if they would be willing to help with more of the customers. Which they sort of did for a short time but then quickly hid away 
            again. At the time I felt it was easier just to igonre them and focus on what I was doing.
            I think now I would have attempted to be firmer in asking them to help out the team.
