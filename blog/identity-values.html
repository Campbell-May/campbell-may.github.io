        <h2> Core Personal Values
        </h2>
        <p>One of the big ethical decisions I have made was the decision to eat a vegan diet. </br>
          It came through a deeper exploration of my values.</br>
          Three key ones that always come up to me are.
          <ul>
            <li>  
              Kindness</li>
              <li>Compassion</li>
              <li>Empathy</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p> 
       
          My awareness of these three main points had me look at my everyday actions and really ask myself whether I was living according to them.</br>
          After lots of research into 
          The condition of animals in farming. Especially those in the heavily industrialised farming industry.
          The impact on the planet in terms of climate change and pollution.
          My own health. Assessing what I am actually putting into my body and what it is that my body needs. 
          It is also really important to me that I am aware of the position of privilege that I have 
          to be able to eat a vegan diet. I always acknowledge how lucky I am to be in a position to choose not to eat meat.
          
          </p>
          <p>It was a very difficult process to undergo as I have been raised by a family of meat eaters.</br>
          It was made more difficult by feelings of resistance and ridicule of my actions. Especially given that my family
           has always been very supportive of any beliefs or ideas I hold.
           Even now there is a lot of sensitivity and misunderstanding between my family and I.
        Yet ultimately it has been very positive. My family now have regular vegetarian meal nights and we 
      are able to discuss </p>
          <h3>
          Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h3>
          
         <p>
          My family has always been very open to any beliefs and political discussion.</br>
          I was raised largely by my grandparents and had a strong sense of family unity.
          From a young age I was instilled with a sense of right or wrong. </br>

            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>
            Communication and working in groups. I enjoy this process. I find it fun and very creative. However this intersects with the learning obstacle of not believing in my abilities and sometimes struggling to find my voice to defend ideas or critique others.

            Working in a customer facing job.
            One of the people I worked with was actively trying to do the bare minimum. 
            Even having headphones in and ignoring customers so that everyone else had to do more work.
            I voiced how I was feeling like myself and other members of the team were having to do more work.
