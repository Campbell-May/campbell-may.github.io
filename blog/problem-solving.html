         <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
         <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>Overthinking is often my enemy when dealing with a simple problem. at times the simplicity of the problem seems to be a trick in itself. 
             During the Manipulating JS Objects I needed to add an object to an object. 
             By adding ben as a object with the key name and value "Ben" to the Terah object. 
             For some reason this idea of adding an object to an object absolutely stumped me. 
             I'm not sure what it was, perhaps the wording was just tripping my mind up. 
             I tried to pseudocode but I just couldn't get my head around what was happening.
             Deciding I needed a break I went for a walk. On the walk it struck me that I had recently added an object to an object in the 
             javascript cafe code along.
             As soon as I got back, I opened up the Javascript cafe code. 
             Just by looking at the way this code was structured was the little missing piece I needed for it to make sense again.

        <h3>Solved a problem Elegantly</h3>
        <p>During Loops challenge 5.</br>
          In this challenge we needed Write a function that takes an array of items and returns a new array that only includes every
           second item. </br>
           In this problem I read the hints first and did some googling to familiarise myself with how forEach is used. 
           This gave me a good idea that I would be applying something that would check each element in the array.
           The next hint was the % operator that tells us what is left over after a value is divided by another value.
              This gave me the clue that I could use this to check if the index of the element in the array was divisible by two. Once I had these two hints 
           I used the pseudocode method. I wrote out the steps that I needed like a a recipe on a piece of paper.
        </p>
           <ul>
             <li>create a variable called results that will hold the new array </li>
             <li>Use a loop to move through the array </li>
             <li> check to see if the index number is divisible by 2</li>
             <li>push these values to the new array</li>
             <li>return the array</li>
           </ul>
            <p>Once I had this recipe I started to write the code line by line. At first it didn't work but I felt sure that I was on the right track.
       I quickly checked on Discord and someone else had asked a question about this particular question. By glancing at the code they had I immediately realised I was just missing a 
         bracket in the right place.
      </br>
            I use this example as a time I solved a question elegantly because even though there was a lot I did not know and at first my code wasn't working 
every time I googled or checked Discord where I felt there was a gap in my knowledge I quickly found a solution.

        <h3>Problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong> Pseudocode</strong> Using pseudocode is something that I am still practicing and reminding myself to do regularly. When I do use this method it is really useful and creates a great framework to help stay on track when 
            problem solving.</li>
            <li> <strong> Trying something</strong> This method is always a go to for me. Sometimes just getting something down gives me something to work with and start to adpat rather than 
            being paralysed staring at a blank canvas. </li>
            <li> <strong> Rubber ducky method</strong> Great method. Feels fun as well to just talk through an idea. Sometimes a little silly but embracing the sillyness can help to bring a lightness and gentle approach to the problem I'm trying to solve.</li>
            <li> <strong> Reading error messages</strong> This is becoming more and more useful. I will often find that just being pointed in the direction of the line that is incorrect allows me to quickly see what is causing the problem.</li>
            <li><strong> Console.logging</strong> Also becoming more useful with practice. Being able to see what is happening in the background gives more information when creating Functions</li>
            <li> <strong> Googling</strong> I feel like I am becoming a Google pro. I find myself doing this without even thinking about it.</li>
            <li> <strong> Asking your peers for help</strong> I would like to do this more, I find that most times someone has already asked a simlar question and there is an exteremly useful thread in Discord just waiting for me.</li>
            <li><strong> Asking coaches for help</strong> The same as asking peers on this one. So far between, myself, Google and my peers there has been no challenge too great. Its really nice to know 
            that the support is there when it is needed</li>
            <li><strong> Improving your process with reflection</strong> Reflections are one of the most useful ways I have found to cement the knowledge that I'm learning. Just the act of recounting small aspects will 
            trigger memories and </li>
