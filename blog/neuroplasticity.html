        <h3> Neuroplasticity</h3>
           <p>
              Neuroplasticity is the ability for connections between neurons in our brain to reorganise themselves. Especially from 
              experience, learning or habits.
              It is all about the idea that our brains are malleable and will react to certain experience. When practicing an instrument for example a series of neurons are firing and connecting. 
              When we practice repeatedly and consistently those neuron pathways begin to strengthen. 
              In general it is the brains ability to adapt. It has a role to play in the formation of habits. Everytime we do a certain action or perform a certain habit 
              we are strengthening those neurons in the brain and further increasing the habit.
           </br>
           Understanding neuroplasticity is very useful to us. It gives us the tools to know how to improve or change a habit. 
          </br> </br>
          One of the best ways to increase neuroplasticity is practice. By repeatedly doing something we are reinforcing those neural networks and making that part of the brain more effecient at 
          accessing the information needed to perform the action.
        </br> </br>
        I found this website really useful in learning about Neuroplasticity <a id="link" href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">Very Well Mind</a>
           </p>
        <h3> Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset follows from the idea of Neuroplasticity. It is the idea that our personality and what we perceive as our traits are not fixed. 
          That we are constantly changing and have the ability to transform our minds and traits. Our Intelligence is not a fixed level 
          it is something that is much more fluid and we have the ability to study or practice to achieve any level of intelligence or proficiency in something that 
          we want. </br>
          I found this exploration fascinating. Just recently I have been listening to a podcast discussing what it is that shapes our perceived personality. How 
          much do external factors like culture, time and experiences create the individual. Or how much is carried in our genetics, is there a level of inherent traits and 
          unique qualities that are present in our DNA that influence the mind. Learning about the increase in ability and achievment of the children that learnt about growth mindset 
          blew me away. It was very encouraging and inspiring to learn about.
        </br> 
        One of the main takeaways I have from learning about Growth Mindset is for feeling good about learning. 
        To really take the time to appreciate when I have come to comprehend something new. I can do this by reminding myself and 
        making a note of my progress. Reminding myself that there was a time that a javascript function was incomprehensible to me. Now 
        I am writing them every day. Celebrating these personal growth wins and appreciating that it comes from 
        being challenged and looking for help. Whether thats from Google, my peers or the tutors.
        </br> </br>
        I found this article from Carol Dweck really useful in learning about Growth Mindset <a id="link" href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">HBR article</a>

        <h3> My Learning Plan</h3>
          <p>
            I am keen to continue learning about Growth Mindset and plan to read Dr Dwecks book to further my understanding.
             It has been really useful in  my learning plan and gives me a lot of encouragement in my approach to Dev Academy. 
             One of the biggest challenges to overcome in my learning plan is the seemingly huge task of learning so much in such a short 
             amount of time. Sometimes it seems like it is impossible to take everything in and retain it. 
             Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset assures me that my brain will be able to take whatever I throw at it and its just a matter 
              of patience, practice and consistency to get where I want to be. 
            </br>
            I loved Carol Dwecks story about there being no grade called Fail, just the grade 'Not Yet'.
