        <h3> Foundations Reflection</h3>
        <h3>Three Things I learnt about me</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> I find it difficult to say no. - The core learnings have helped me to take a closer look at myself through foundations and be more mindful of the things that take my time and attention.
              I have noticed that sometimes I do find it difficult to set boundaries. Especially when living with a flat of friends and back in Wellington close to family. 
            Although this is a great support, it means there is always a great distraction from study just around the corner.  </li>
            <li>Growth Mindset - I knew little bits and pieces about neuroplasticity and growth mindset but this is the first time I have really read more 
              in depth about what it is. Which has been incredibly empowering and brings a new way for me to think about myself and the way I learn.
            </li>
            <li>I am more free than my mind allows me to believe. - This comes from my learnings with growth mindset. Just being aware that often the voice of self doubt 
              in my head is actually very weak.   </li>
          </ul>
          

          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
              Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness are very important in learning. They all tie in with how we relate and interact with others. Which for me is the most crucial part of learning 
              being able to understand and learn from others. In Foundations one of the best ways to learn how to do something was to ask others or read other peoples messages and threads to understand 
              their thought processes and ideas.
            </br>
            Learning and programming can be challenging. When going through the same process with others Empathy helps us to feel like we aren't alone. 
            To understand how others feel through bootcamp there can be a feeling of solidarity that helps everyone.
          </br>
          When coming up against challenges Self Awareness can help to guide us through. The more we know ourselves, how we react under pressure or how we can dissapate anger 
          the easier it is to stay on track with learning and programming. If we know how to manage anxiety that comes up then we are better equipped for any challenge.
            </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                The thing that surprised me the most about the core learnings was how powerful the learnings of growth mindset were. Learning about the data and testing that Carol Dweck is working from was amazing. 
                The rates of achievement in previously low performing schools were just incredible. 
              </p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                I think one of the most challenging aspects of the core learning was really adressing myself and my ego. 
                Having to write about myself and my experience is uncomfortable and I definitely  noticed when doing the listening and looping exercises that I 
                felt very conscious about what I was saying. However I also noticed how good i felt after the Listening and Looping to speak and be heard by someone. 
                Noticing this feeling is great. It has helped me a lot over the past 5 weeks. Each time I have been on a call with someone or in the homegroup meeting 
                I have noticed that I am slightly more at ease and better able to express myself. 
              </p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>
                In terms of the end result being getting a person employable as a web developer I think that it is very important that the person has the core skills to work with others. 
                To be able to communicate with others and be a part of a team. Like Joseph said in his intro videos, people want to work with nice people. 
                I think its also a great way to make the field more approachable to someone like me. After university I felt like I had a good idea that the tech industry was quite cold 
                and data driven. That it was about performance and competition and I wouldn't be able to get to such a technically competitive level. Dev Academy provides an approachable 
                way of teaching tech, it definitly gives me a different view of the industry and the encouragement that I can be a web developer if I want to be.
                
              </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>I think the time I have spent studying core learnings has been very beneficial to me. Especially while learning programming as it gives you the tools to deal with the challenges and frustrations that 
                  you will undoubtedly face. 
                </br>
              But regardless of learning programming I think knowledge of mindfulness, active listening and neuroplasticity are incredibly useful in all aspects of life. Whether I am working as a programmer or not 
            a lot of the things I have learnt will help me grow as a person.  </p>
