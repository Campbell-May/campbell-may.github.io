        <h3> Emotional Intelligence
        </h3>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence can be broken down into these main aspects.</br></br>

          -Having the ability to identify or name the emotions that you feel. This is a critical first step of
           self awareness. Being able to put a name to what you are feeling. Or even if it is not a name. Perhaps you can remember a time 
           that you felt that way before.        </br>
           </br> -The ability to harness those emotions and work with them. Once you have become aware of an emotion you
           bring light to it and what it is can be managed rather than fighting the unknown.
          have as much power. It is no longer the unknown and you can begin to work with the emotion. When we
           resist strong emotions or try to suppress them it may work against us by intensifying the feelings. 
           By recognising that we are angry we can see that and decide what to do from a place of awareness. 
           We may know that when we are angry we need to seek space and calmness for a moment to allow the feelings to subside.
          </br> </br>-The ability to manage emotions. This is for managing your own emotions and helping other people manage their own.
        </br> </br>-The ability to recognise those emotions in others. Then once you recognise them you can help them to manage. It gives us insight 
        in to how to manage interactions with others. If we can have a sense of empathy and understand how someone else feels we may 
        be better equipped to see the outcome of our interactions with them.
      <h3>How is it different to IQ</h3>
      <p>
          IQ focuses on our ability to use logic and problem solving and then communicate complex ideas with others.
           It is focused more on the academic capabilities of an individual.         </br>
          </br>
          Emotional Intelligence is also cultivated in a different way to IQ. Where IQ can be taught through linear and logical methods. Emotional Intelligence is much 
          more experiential.  Thats why one of the main ways to begin increasing our emotional Intelligence is to practice meditation 
          or mindfulness. Which could be said to be learning to not 'do', encouraging us to let go and just to experience what we feel in the moment. 
           The comparison between Knowledge and Wisdom is useful here as well.
           While IQ could be increased by remembering facts and knowing tricky calculations.
           We can not read a lot about empathy and know its definition for it to be of use. 
          For it to be of use we need to feel Empathy towards someone.
          </p>
          <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional Intellingence is incredibly important as it encompasses everything, the way we treat ourselves and those around us. 
            It is the tools that we have to manage the emotions that we feel and our ability to commuicate clearly and constructively with others.
            In our everyday lives its crucial for us to be able to manage our mental health. 
            The social side of emotional Intelligence is also very important. Our interactions with others, how we communicate and the connections we make 
            have huge impacts on our happiness and individual experience but also the experience of others.
